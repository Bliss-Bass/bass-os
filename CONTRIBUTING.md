# Contributing to Bass OS

We are not going to require any elitist rules for you to contribute to the project. That's just silly. So this doc will cover the various parts of the project and explain how to do things. 

## General Development

This project contains many scripts and tools that help aid the support, feature selection, and option customization for Bass OS. Most of those scripts use bash and can also interface with the easy-menu-system we include. 

## Addon Development

Further information can be found in our [Addon Development documentation](https://docs.blisscolabs.dev/development/addon-development/)
